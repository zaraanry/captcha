# Numerical CAPTCHA Solver (Keras/TensorFlow)

A compact CNN that learns to solve **5-digit numeric CAPTCHAs** generated on the fly.  
It uses a shared convolutional trunk with **one softmax head per digit** (multi-head classification).

---

## How It Works

### 1) Dataset Generation
- Renders digit strings with `ImageCaptcha(width=135, height=50)`.
- Captchas are generated by permutation each **N=5** number **M=8** times. This means all the valid 5 digit numbers are available in our dataset and each one has 8 different Captcha samples. 
- Files are written under `train/data/` with labels in the filename, e.g. `12345_<uuid>.png`.

### 2) Preprocessing
- Convert to **grayscale** 
- Downscale by **2×** (from 135×50 to **67×25**).
- Labels are one-hot per position  `(N, NUM_OF_LETTERS, 10)`.

### 3) Model
Shared CNN backbone + **one softmax head per digit (10 classes each)**:

```
Input: (25, 67, 1)
Conv2D(32, 5×5) → MaxPool(2×2)
Conv2D(48, 5×5) → MaxPool(2×2)
Conv2D(64, 5×5) → MaxPool(2×2)
Dropout(0.3) → Flatten → Dense(512, relu) → Dropout(0.3)
Heads: Dense(10, softmax) × NUM_OF_LETTERS
```

- Loss: Categorical cross-entropy (per head)
- Metrics: Accuracy (per head)
- Typical defaults: `EPOCHS = 50`, `BATCH_SIZE = 128`
